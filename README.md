Personal xVideo Player WordPress Plugin. It's Working If you have Your Own Hosting Server. If you upload a Video to your Hosting and get a link and embed, then that's working 100%.
The webpage layout features a clean and straightforward video player section combined with integrated ad units for monetisation and channel promotion.

**Video Player:**
- Centralized placement with a clear title.
- Modern HTML5-style player controls (play, pause, volume, quality settings, and fullscreen options).
- A wide rectangular format designed for high-resolution playback.
- Smooth progress bar and adjustable playback speed for user convenience.

**Ad Units:**
- Top Banner Ad: 728x90 
- Bottom Banner Ad: 728x90 
- Side Widget (Join Our Channels): A sleek, rounded-corner card featuring three social buttons (WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram). Each button is color-coded with recognizable platform branding and strong call-to-action text like Join Channel or Follow Us.

**Overall Design Impression**
The layout is user-friendly, engaging, and monetization-focused, combining video content with interactive ads and social growth strategies. Bright colors and bold CTAs make the ad units stand out, while the video player remains the central focus of the page.
